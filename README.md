# QatarAirwaysFeedback
In this project, I utilized R to extract and analyze customer feedback and experiences shared on Reddit. The dataset captured passengers' frustrations during trips, at airports, and in Qatar Airways lounges. Using R, I processed this feedback, compiled the information, and created visualizations to provide actionable insights.

The analysis focused on four key areas:

1. Keyword Comparison (Pre- and Post-COVID): Identifying shifts in customer concerns and priorities.
2. Frequent Phrases and Terms: Highlighting commonly mentioned topics to understand recurring themes.
3. Customer Sentiment and Emotional Response: Categorizing feedback into positive, neutral, or negative sentiment to assess overall satisfaction.
4. Word Similarity and Language Trends: Exploring patterns in language usage to uncover underlying customer perceptions.

The ultimate goal was to provide Qatar Airways with insights into areas requiring improvement to enhance the overall passenger experience and better serve its customers.
